# MediStegFramework
The basis for evaluating the distortion introduced into medical images during watermarking security data embedding has been mostly based on human visual system (HVS). With the advent of computer vision and machine learning, modifications in images at micro-level not visible to the naked eyes could be recognised. This micro-recognition of changes could affect machine decisions in auto-diagnosis performed in a remote location during automated telediagnosis. In this paper, a conceptual and software frameworks are proposed to encourage transparent and standardised evaluation methods that incorporates both traditional signal processing and evolving quality metrics . Evaluations using medical image biomarkers relevant to the image type being secured by watermarking are advocated to be utilised in a disease classification process before accepting or rejecting a watermarking algorithm proposed for use in auto-diagnosis. 

#To Run this Project
This project is an eclipse java project. Import the project into eclipse and click 'run' on the eclipse window to run the project. You can then continue extending the framework.

Design diagrams will be provided in future to aid your understanding of the project.
